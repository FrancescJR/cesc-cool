            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Short story (summary, TL;DR for the long story)</h3>
            <p>Hello! It is most certainly a pleasure to meet you.</p>
            <p>I am an engineer born and raised in Barcelona and seasoned in Japan for 5 years. My major
            is computer science and since I graduated I have been working on the development of full web applications
            and systems. I try to always follow SOLID principles and to have a DDD approach to problems. Those and
                a goo devops mindset are the best tools to minimiza technical debt and make the SCRUM velocity
                of any team soar.</p>

            <h3>Long story</h3>
            <p>I am an engineer - graduated on "informatics" which is computer science, but it is not computer science
                as probably it is on USA, but anyway I graduated long time ago so that doesn't matter that much anymore</p>
            <p> I've been born and raised in Barcelona but my professional experience -without counting a long internship-
                started in Japan where I lived almost 5 years</p>
            <p> Now, though, it's been almost the same amount of time in Barcelona already, again.</p>
            <p> I always worked on distributed systems on internet. I used to use Drupal and CMS and now I run away
                from them as much as possible. But I can't deny that thanks to Drupal I got the change to live and
                work in Japan and that is something that I will always be grateful for.</p>
            <p>I always -well, ehem, since I was aware of them, but it's been some time now- try to follow SOLID principles
                and I also try to have a Domain Driven Design approach to the development - Hexagonal Architecture, Aggregates,
                Value Objects and recently getting messy with even sourcing and CQRS projections...</p>
            <p>I believe DDD is the only approach that actually minimizes technical debt. This and a good devops mindset.</p>
            <p>Devops should be a competence not a job title, and while I like that there are experts about the tools
                and directions and everything that you can learn from them, they should never be unaware of the business
                at hand, of the domain.</p>
            <p>Strongly believe that team members should have T shaped skills (while devops skills should be the strongest
                second skill for every member, so I am not sure which would be the resulting letter) and that teams should
                be autonomous to deploy to production and solve the problems without having to ask anything to people that
                are probably unrelated to the question at hand.</p>
            <p>So </p>

            <h4>Books</h4>
            <p> This is a list of technical books that I have read and some of them re-read, that helped me shape
            my beliefs and my points of views of what IT on every company -big, small, start-up etc- should be.</p>




            <h4>Side Hustles</h4>
            <p> Isn't that the trend word? Well I own a business where the main goal is to have some passive income (with
                the condition of using the least effort possible, which sometimes this minimum effort is quite big when
                speaking about bureaucracy and entrepreneurship requirements).</p>
            <p>The second goal is that I can get to learn and actually use in production many tools, languages, techniques,
                patterns and other things that I don't get to see often on my current job.</p>
            <p>Having the condition that I am doing the least effort possible (I know the exact minimum effort one needs
                to do in order to learn something, actually the trick is to deal with frustration) so I let myself
                be helped by some trust people that I know that are very good - because I work with them- and that I can
                learn from them a lot. We will share the passive income. I am fair on that.</p>
            <p>So adding to the tech buss words that can be also be confused by Pokemon, here's more terms that I am
            working with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terraform, a lot! (well I used to work with that at Xceed).</li>
                <li>Github actions (I start to have my own).</li>
                <li>Lua with Love2d to make stupid computer games. Just that I don't like lua with it's faulty classes system
                that are actually tables with weird meta attributes there.</li>
                <li>React, as this web page and even some games, so that is Javascript. Javascript? NO! like, who can work
                with that? I couldn't spend more than 2 hours that I had to google "how to make javascript less sucky" and
                    found typescript, and ok, it's Microsoft, but I have to give it to them, it's a good invention. Now I can
                    work with javascript!and react and others. Still there's some problems, like, wtf, arrays? this is
                the base of the languages! I will use this page to expose a problem I found that I yet need to find a solution.</li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Others</h4>
            <p>You might have noticed that I like to write... a lot. Especially with my Thinkpad lenovo keyboard. Nothing
            can be compared to the feeling your fingers get when you type on that keyboard.</p>
            <p>That's because I have now a platform to express, but I know the value of listening and I am normally
            more of a listener - not by nature but because I force myself.</p>
            <p>In general I am easygoing, and I try to show and display my vulnerabilities, especially when I don't know
                something. On some environments it's hard, but somehow I find my way, and eventually others start feeling
                less fearful and worried to display their ignorance, and they start to ask questions too, and
                finally communication flows without fear. On the company I am now that is a reality in my team, but at
                company level there's a long path for that, and I don't like it.</p>
            <p>I hate being at odds with people, so whenever I have any conflict, I need to find the common ground sooner
                than later. Just that sometimes the conflict is necessary, even if it's just to realize that there is
                actually no common ground yet.(There always will be, I can always make an effort and with good
                reasoning I can be easily convinced)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I'm awesome when I'm awesome. I love working as much working as I love not working.</p>

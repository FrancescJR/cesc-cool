            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>You might have noticed that I like to write... a lot. Especially with my Thinkpad lenovo keyboard. Nothing
                can be compared to the feeling your fingers get when you type on that keyboard.</p>
            <p>That's because I have now a platform to express, but I know the value of listening and I am normally
                more of a listener - not by nature but because I force myself.</p>

            <p>And the platform is blogger. I had many during the years. Right now I just write mainly for myself.
            I switched Blogger for Penzu. Before I used to share my posts on Facebook and everywhere, but my Facebook
            account is kind of inactive and I don't dare to show my deepest thoughts there. It's just my cowardice, because
            those posts were written with an audience in mind.</p>
            <p>Well here you will find some of the posts, the few ones I dare to have public now.  I have all the old ones
                too but not published</p>

            <p>I'm awesome when I'm awesome. I love working as much working as I love not working.</p>

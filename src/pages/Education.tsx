                    <p>I always hated the fact that informatics doesn't translate properly to English. Computer science
                    doesn't seem to match 100% to the same.</p>
                    <p>Also, I did it long time ago and the plan was quite different than nowadays degrees where
                    they last 3 years and then you are supposed to do a master.</p>
                    <p>This degree was 5 years, and it kind of included a master in it, which one? well, I was about to
                    change plan and then I saw that I had all the available 5 masters that the Faculty was offering
                    already completed at 80%, I just needed to do a final thesis for each of them (and on some
                        I was also missing some non-mandatory credits) and I'd have 5 masters!</p>

                    <p>An Erasmus stay on the countryside of the Netherlands. Eindhoven is nicknamed as the -yet another-

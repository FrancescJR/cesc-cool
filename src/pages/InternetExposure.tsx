            <h4>Social Media</h4>
            <p>I am not much active on social media. I reply linkedIn messages and I post from time to time
            on Instagram. Facebook is there to keep some contacts, but a part from that is like I don't have it.</p>
            <p>This is my instagram account: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href={'https://www.instagram.com/cesc_decko_car/?hl=en'}>
                https://www.instagram.com/cesc_decko_car/?hl=en</a></p>
            <p>LinkedIn: <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
                            href={"https://es.linkedin.com/in/francesc-travesa-3a836130"}>https://es.linkedin.com/in/francesc-travesa-3a836130</a>
            </p>
            <p>And facebook if you want to see some picture from &lt; 2012 is here:

            <h4>Writing</h4>
            <p>You might have noticed that I like to write... a lot. Especially with my Thinkpad lenovo keyboard. Nothing
                can be compared to the feeling your fingers get when you type on that keyboard.</p>
            <p>The platform I use is blogger. I had many during the years. Right now I just write mainly for myself.
            I switched Blogger for Penzu. Before I used to share my posts on Facebook and everywhere, but my Facebook
            account is kind of inactive and I don't dare to show my deepest thoughts there. It's just my cowardice, because
            those posts were written with an audience in mind. Let's say I have sometimes bursts of bravery, then I post publicly everywhere, and
                on the following day my cowardice gains terrain and I put it all back to private again.</p>
            <p>Well here you will find some of the posts, the few ones I dare to have public now. I have all the old ones
                too but this time I haven't published them.</p>
            <p><a href={'http://economic.cesc.cool/'} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >http://economic.cesc.cool/</a></p>

            <p>I will probably write some books. One that I have a little bit unorganized but with chapters all over
                Penzu will be about some bad coding practices that I've been seeing among the years. This book
                will be intended for technical people though, with code examples, and written as a satire and also
                as autocriticism.</p>

            <br/>
            <p>I'm awesome when I'm awesome. I love working as much working as I love not working.</p>

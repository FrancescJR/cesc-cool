            <p>So adding to the tech buss words that can be also be confused by Pokemon, here's more terms that I am
                working with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terraform, a lot! (well I used to work with that at Xceed).</li>
                <li>Github actions (I start to have my own).</li>
                <li>Lua with Love2d to make stupid computer games. Just that I don't like lua with it's faulty classes system
                    that are actually tables with weird meta attributes there.</li>
                <li>React, as this web page and even some games, so that is Javascript. Javascript? NO! like, who can work
                    with that? I couldn't spend more than 2 hours that I had to google "how to make javascript less sucky" and
                    found typescript, and ok, it's Microsoft, but I have to give it to them, it's a good invention. Now I can
                    work with javascript!and react and others. Still there's some problems, like, wtf, arrays? this is
                    the base of the languages! I will use this page to expose a problem I found that I yet need to find a solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <p> Isn't that the trend word? Well I own a business where the main goal is to have some passive income (with
                the condition of using the least effort possible, which sometimes this minimum effort is quite big when
                speaking about bureaucracy and entrepreneurship requirements).</p>
            <p>The second goal is that I can get to learn and actually use in production many tools, languages, techniques,
                patterns and other things that I don't get to see often on my current job.</p>
            <p>Having the condition that I am doing the least effort possible (I know the exact minimum effort one needs
                to do in order to learn something, actually the trick is to deal with frustration) so I let myself
                be helped by some trust people that I know that are very good - because I work with them- and that I can
                learn from them a lot. We will share the passive income. I am fair on that.</p>
            <p>So adding to the tech buss words that can be also be confused by Pokemon, here's more terms that I am
                working with: </p>

            <p> Isn't that the trend word? Well I own a business where the main goal is to have some passive income (with
                the condition of using the least effort possible, which sometimes this minimum effort is quite big when
                speaking about bureaucracy and entrepreneurship requirements).</p>
            <p>The second goal is that I can get to learn and actually use in production many tools, languages, techniques,
                patterns and other things that I don't get to see often on my current job.</p>
            <p>Having the condition that I am doing the least effort possible (I know the exact minimum effort one needs
                to do in order to learn something, actually the trick is to deal with frustration) so I let myself
                be helped by some trust people that I know that are very good - because I work with them- and that I can
                learn from them a lot. We will share the passive income. I am fair on that.</p>
            <p>So adding to the tech buss words that can be also be confused by Pokemon, here's more terms that I am
                working with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Terraform, a lot! (well I used to work with that at Xceed).</li>
                <li>Github actions (I start to have my own).</li>
                <li>Lua with Love2d to make stupid computer games. Just that I don't like lua with it's faulty classes system
                    that are actually tables with weird meta attributes there.</li>
                <li>React, as this web page and even some games, so that is Javascript. Javascript? NO! like, who can work
                    with that? I couldn't spend more than 2 hours that I had to google "how to make javascript less sucky" and
                    found typescript, and ok, it's Microsoft, but I have to give it to them, it's a good invention. Now I can
                    work with javascript!and react and others. Still there's some problems, like, wtf, arrays? this is
                    the base of the languages! I will use this page to expose a problem I found that I yet need to find a solution.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

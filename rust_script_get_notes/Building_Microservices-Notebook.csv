"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 7","","Rolling out a feature that requires changes to more than one microservice is expensive. You need to coordinate the work across each service (and potentially across separate teams) and carefully manage the order in which the new versions of these services are deployed. That takes a lot more work than making the same change inside a single service (or inside a monolith, for that matter). It therefore follows that we want to find ways to make cross-service changes as infrequent as possible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 17","","distributed monolith is a system that consists of multiple services, but for whatever reason, the entire system must be deployed together. A distributed monolith might well meet the definition of an SOA, but all too often, it fails to deliver on the promises of SOA. In my experience, a distributed monolith has all the disadvantages of a distributed system, and the disadvantages of a single-process monolith, without having enough of the upsides of either."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 34","","Microservice architectures can give you a huge degree of flexibility in choosing technology, handling robustness and scaling, organizing teams, and more. This flexibility is in part why many people are embracing microservice architectures. But microservices bring with them a significant degree of complexity, and you need to ensure that this complexity is warranted. For many, they have become a default system architecture, to be used in virtually all situations. However, I still think that they are an architectural choice whose use must be justified by the problems you are trying to solve; often, simpler approaches can deliver much more easily. Nonetheless, many organizations, especially larger ones, have shown how effective microservices can be. When the core concepts of microservices are properly understood and implemented, they can help create empowering, productive architectures that can help systems become more than the sum of their parts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 41","","Domain Coupling Domain coupling describes a situation in which one microservice needs to interact with another microservice, because the first microservice needs to make use of the functionality that the other microservice provides.8 In Figure 2-2, we see part of how orders for CDs are managed"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 42","","As a general rule, domain coupling is considered to be a loose form of coupling, although even here we can hit problems."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 54","","these relationships between aggregates exist inside the scope of a single microservice, they could easily be stored using something like a foreign key relationship if using a relational database. If the relationships between these aggregates span microservice boundaries, though, we need some way to model the relationships. Now, we could simply store the ID of the aggregate directly in our local database."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 57","","Shared models We can also have concepts that appear in more than one bounded context. In Figure 2-14 we saw that a customer exists in both locations. What does this mean? Is the customer copied? The way to think about this is that conceptually, both finance and the warehouse need to know something about our customer. Finance needs to know about the financial payments made to a customer, whereas the warehouse needs to know about the customer to the extent that it knows what packages have been sent so as to allow for deliveries to be traced. When you have a situation like this, a shared model like customer can have different meanings in the different bounded contexts and therefore might be called different things. We might be happy to keep the name “customer” in finance, but in the warehouse we might call them a “recipient,” as that is the role they play in that context. We store information about the customer in both locations, but the information is different. Finance stores information about the customer’s financial payments (or refunds); the warehouse stores information related to the goods shipped. We still may need to link both local concepts to a global customer, and we may want to look up common, shared information about that customer like their name or email address—we could use a technique like that shown in Figure 2-13 to achieve this."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 58","","Mapping Aggregates and Bounded Contexts to Microservices Both the aggregate and the bounded context give us units of cohesion with well-defined interfaces with the wider system. The aggregate is a self-contained state machine that focuses on a single domain concept in our system, with the bounded context representing a collection of associated aggregates, again with an explicit interface to the wider world. Both can therefore work well as service boundaries. When starting out, as I’ve already mentioned, you want to reduce the number of services you work with. As a result, you should probably target services that encompass entire bounded contexts. As you find your feet and decide to break these services into smaller services, you need to remember that aggregates themselves don’t want to be split apart—one microservice can manage one or more aggregates, but we don’t want one aggregate to be managed by more than one microservice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 61","","bounded contexts, which are so important to DDD, are explicitly about hiding information—presenting a clear boundary to the wider system while hiding internal complexity that is able to change without impacting other parts of the system. This means that when we follow a DDD approach, whether we realize it or not, we are also adopting information hiding—and as we’ve seen, this is vital in helping to find stable microservice boundaries. Secondly, the focus on defining a common, ubiquitous language helps greatly when it comes to defining microservice endpoints. It neatly gives us a shared vocabulary to draw on when coming up with APIs, event formats, and the like. It also helps solve the problem of how far the standardization of APIs needs to go in terms of allowing language to change within bounded contexts—change inside a boundary impacting that boundary itself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 68","","hope you can see by now, I’m not a fan of horizontally layered architecture. Layering can have its place, though. Within a microservice boundary, it can be totally sensible to delineate between different layers to make the code easier to manage. The problem occurs when this layering becomes the mechanism by which your microservice and ownership boundaries are drawn."

Coming back to Figure 3-6, with both the Album and Ledger tables being in the same database, we could (and likely would) define a foreign key relationship between the rows in the Ledger table and the Album table. This would ensure that we’d always be able to navigate from a record in the Ledger table back to information about the album sold, as we wouldn’t be able to delete records from the Album table if they were referenced in Ledger."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 111","","Do be wary, though, about the world of middleware, of which the message broker is just a small part. Queues in and of themselves are perfectly sensible, useful things. However, vendors tend to want to package lots of software with them, which can lead to more and more smarts being pushed into the middleware, as evidenced by things like the enterprise service bus. Make sure you know what you’re getting: keep your middleware dumb, and keep the smarts in the endpoints."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 123","","There is a whole host of technology we could look at, but rather than looking broadly at a long list of options, I will highlight some of the most popular and interesting choices. Here are the options we’ll be looking at: Remote procedure calls Frameworks that allow for local method calls to be invoked on a remote process. Common options include SOAP and gRPC. REST An architectural style where you expose resources (Customer, Order, etc.) that can be accessed using a common set of verbs (GET, POST). There is a bit more to REST than this, but we’ll get to that shortly. GraphQL A relatively new protocol that allows consumers to define custom queries that can fetch information from multiple downstream microservices, filtering the results to return only what is needed. Message brokers Middleware that allows for asynchronous communication via queues or topics."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 134","","Compared with normal REST-based HTTP APIs, caching is also more complex. With REST-based APIs, I can set one of many response headers to help client-side devices, or intermediate caches like content delivery networks (CDNs), cache responses so they don’t need to be requested again. This isn’t possible in the same way with GraphQL."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 134","","The advice I’ve seen on this issue seems to revolve around just associating an ID with every returned resource (and remember, a GraphQL query could contain multiple resources) and then having the client device cache the request against that ID. As far as I can tell, this makes using CDNs or caching reverse proxies incredibly difficult without additional work."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 156","","The argument is that this makes it easy to use your service and avoids the duplication of code required to consume the service itself. The problem, of course, is that if the same people create both the server API and the client API, there is a danger that logic that should exist on the server will start leaking into the client."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 156","","However, according to at least one person at Netflix, over time this has led to a degree of coupling between client and server that has been problematic."
"Note","Page 156","","One person lol"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 163","","Being focused more on north-south traffic, the API gateway’s main concern in a microservices environment is mapping requests from external parties to internal microservices. This responsibility is akin to what you could achieve with a simple HTTP proxy, and in fact API gateways typically build more features on top of existing HTTP proxy products, and they largely function as reverse proxies. In addition, API gateways can be used to implement mechanisms like API keys for external parties, logging, rate limiting, and the like."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 164","","examples I’ve seen of misuse of API gateways is for call aggregation and protocol rewriting, but I’ve also seen a wider push to use API gateways for in-perimeter (east-west) calls too. In this chapter we’ve already briefly looked at the usefulness of a protocol like GraphQL to help us in a situation in which we need to make a number of calls and then aggregate and filter the results, but people are often tempted to solve this problem in API gateway layers too. It starts off innocently enough: you combine a couple of calls and return a single payload. Then you start making another downstream call as part of the same aggregated flow. Then you start wanting to add conditional logic, and before long you realize that you’ve baked core business processes into a third-party tool that is ill suited to the task. If you find yourself needing to do call aggregation and filtering, then look at the potential of GraphQL or the BFF pattern, which we’ll cover in Chapter 14. If the call aggregation you are performing is fundamentally a business process, then this is better done through an explicitly modeled saga, which we’ll cover in Chapter 6. Aside from the aggregation angle, protocol rewriting is also often pushed as something API gateways should be used for. I remember one unnamed vendor very aggressively promoting the idea that its product could “change any SOAP API into a REST API.” Firstly, REST is an entire architectural mindset that cannot simply be implemented in a proxy layer. Secondly, protocol rewriting, which is fundamentally what this is trying to do, shouldn’t be done in intermediate layers, as it’s pushing too much behavior to the wrong place."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 185","","It’s really important to note that a saga allows us to recover from business failures, not technical failures. For example, if we try and take payment from the customer but the customer has insufficient funds, then this is a business failure that the saga should be expected to handle. On the other hand, if the Payment Gateway times out or throws a 500 Internal Service Error, then this is a technical failure that we need to handle separately. The saga assumes the underlying components are working properly—that the underlying system is reliable, and that we are then coordinating the work of reliable components."

First, by its nature, this is a somewhat coupled approach."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 190","","The other issue, which is more subtle, is that logic that should otherwise be pushed into the services can start to become absorbed in the orchestrator instead. If this begins to happen, you may find that your services become anemic, with little behavior of their own, just taking orders from orchestrators like the Order Processor."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 193","","One of the easiest ways of doing this is to project a view regarding the state of a saga by consuming the events being emitted. If we generate a unique ID for the saga, what is known as a correlation ID, we can put it into all of the events that are emitted as part of this saga. When one of our services reacts to an event, the correlation ID is extracted and used for any local logging processes, and it’s also passed downstream with any further calls or events that are fired. We could then have a service whose job it is to just vacuum up all these events and present a view of what state each order is in, and perhaps programmatically carry out actions to resolve issues as part of the fulfillment process if the other services couldn’t do it themselves."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 199","","The problem is that when you work on a feature branch, you aren’t regularly integrating your changes with everyone else. Fundamentally, you are delaying integration. And when you finally decide to integrate your changes with everyone else, you’ll have a much more complex merge. The alternative approach is to have everyone check in to the same “trunk” of source code. To keep changes from impacting other people, techniques like feature flags are used to “hide” incomplete work. This technique of everyone working off the same trunk is called trunk-based development. The discussion around this topic is nuanced, but my own take is that the benefits of frequent integration—and validation of that integration—are significant enough that trunk-based development is my preferred style of development. Moreover, the work to implement feature flags is frequently beneficial in terms of progressive delivery, a concept we’ll explore in Chapter 8."

As we’ve already discussed, continuous delivery is the concept whereby each check-in is treated as a release candidate, and whereby we can assess the quality of each release candidate to decide if it’s ready to be deployed. With continuous deployment on the other hand, all check-ins have to be validated using automated mechanisms (tests for example), and any software that passes these verification checks is deployed automatically, without human intervention. Continuous deployment can therefore be considered an extention of continuous delivery. Without continuous delivery, you can’t do continuous deployment. But you can do continuous delivery without doing continuous deployment. Continuous"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 204","","Secondly, the artifact you verify should be the artifact you deploy!

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 206","","This model can work perfectly well if you buy into the idea of lockstep releases, where you don’t mind deploying multiple services at once. In general, this is absolutely a pattern to avoid,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 208","","When using this pattern, there is nothing to stop a microservice from depending on other code that is managed in different repositories. A simple mechanism for doing this is to have the code you want to reuse packaged into a library that then becomes an explicit dependency of the downstream microservices."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 209","","I’ve spoken to multiple people who find the lack of atomic deployment with this to be a significant problem. I can certainly appreciate the complexity this brings, but I think that in most cases it points to a bigger underlying issue. If you are continually making changes across multiple microservices, then your service boundaries might not be in the right place, and it could imply too much coupling between your services. As we’ve already discussed, we’re trying to optimize our architecture, and our microservice boundaries, so that changes are more likely going to apply within a microservice boundary. Cross-cutting changes should be the exception, not the norm."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 212","","One of the benefits of a monorepo approach is that we can practice finer-grained reuse across projects. With a multirepo model, if I want to reuse someone else’s code, it will likely have to be packaged as a versioned artifact that I can then include as part of my build (such as a Nuget package, a JAR file, or an NPM). With our unit of reuse being a library, we are potentially pulling in more code than we really want. Theoretically, with a monorepo I could just depend on a single source file from another project—although this of course will cause me to have a more complex build mapping."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 213","","With strong ownership, some code is owned by a specific group of people. If someone from outside that group wants to make a change, they have to ask the owners to make the change for them. Weak ownership still has the concept of defined owners, but people outside the ownership group are allowed to make changes, although any of these changes must be reviewed and accepted by someone in the ownership group. This would cover a pull request being sent to the core ownership team for review, before the pull request is merged. With collective ownership, any developer can change any piece of code."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 213","","Some source code tools allow you to specify ownership of specific directories or even specific filepaths inside a single repository. Google initially implemented this system on top of Perforce for its own monorepo before developing its own source control system, and it’s also something that GitHub has supported since 2016. With GitHub, you create a CODEOWNERS file, which lets you map owners to directories or filepaths."

So the databases for Invoice and Order might both be served by the same underlying database engine and hardware, as shown in Figure 8-6.

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 224","","teams that run on public cloud providers are much more likely to provision dedicated database infrastructure on a per-microservice basis, as shown in Figure 8-7. The costs of provisioning and managing this infrastructure are much lower. AWS’s Relational Database Service (RDS), for example, can automatically handle concerns like backups, upgrades, and multiavailability zone failover, and similar products are available from the other public cloud providers. This makes it much more cost effective to have more isolated infrastructure for your microservice, giving each microservice owner more control rather than having to rely on a shared service."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 226","","This means that environments closer to the developer will be tuned to provide fast feedback, which may compromise how “production-like” they are. But as environments get closer to production, we will want them to be more and more like the end production environment to ensure that we catch problems."

If you’re making use of domain-driven design, you may already have explicitly modeled your aggregates (a collection of objects that are managed as a single entity, typically referring to real-world concepts). If your microservice instance handles multiple aggregates, one model that makes sense to me is to break out a function for each aggregate, as shown in Figure 8-19. This ensures that all the logic for a single aggregate is self-contained inside the function, making it easier to ensure a consistent implementation of the life-cycle management of the aggregate."

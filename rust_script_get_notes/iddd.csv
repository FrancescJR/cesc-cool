"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 281","","Sometimes it may be desirable to create a “mini-layer” of Domain Services above the rest of your domain model Entities and Value Objects. As I previously indicated, this will often lead down the precarious path of Anemic Domain Model, which should be considered an anti-pattern. Yet, there are some systems where designing in the mini-layer of Domain Services makes more sense than in others and will not lead to Anemic Domain Model. It depends on the characteristics of the domain model, and in the case of the Identity and Access Context this is actually quite helpful. If you were to experience working in such a domain and you did decide to produce a mini-layer of Domain Services, remember that such are always different from Application Services in the Application Layer. Address transactions and security as application concerns in Application Services, not in Domain Services."

The code smell here might be called Repository masks Aggregate mis-design. However, what if you encounter this situation and your analysis indicates that your Aggregate boundaries are well designed?

Some may think that by declaring this as a Shared Kernel (3), it indemnifies the approach. However, be aware that the convenience of objects that are shared between systems can lead you down a slippery slope.
